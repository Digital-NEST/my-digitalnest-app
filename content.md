## NEST Vision

Latinx youth deserve the same access to resources to nurture their talents, wisdom, and passions as their middle-class, upper-class peers. Yet, these under-resourced communities remain less likely to acquire career-building skills and graduate from college or have robust networks to help them secure well-paying jobs.

Digital NEST creates sustainable and scalable technology learning centers for Latinx youth to provide the skills, network, and resources to foster economic equality. We achieve this by teaching our members the technical and soft skills to be competitive in our digital world, providing mentors, and broadening networks to gain sustainable employment.
